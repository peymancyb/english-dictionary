### TECHNICAL TASK
---
Build a UI that allows queries against the English dictionary.
Your goal is to have a UI that lets the user query the dictionary with different queries, such as:
1. How many words start with the letter &lt;LETTER&gt;
2. How many times does the letter &lt;LETTER&gt; appear in the dictionary?
3. How many words end with the letter &lt;LETTER&gt;?
4. How many words have the same letter repeated in conjunction? 

For instance, the word professor has "ss", and for that, the count is 1.\
If you got other queries you&#39;d like to add, feel free to do so.

- Add charts to the UI.
- The UI should be appealing.

Tools that must be used:

• React\
• State Management (MobX)\
• Emotion.sh\
• TypeScript

Other than that, you decide how&#39;s it&#39;s going to work and look.\
Submit your work using GitHub.\
Cloning, running yarn &amp;&amp; yarn start should make it work.
